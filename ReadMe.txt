Project 2

Notes:
The scoreText object will not stay in place. 
When starting the game it is not visible and it sometimes jumps around the axes. 
I have even tried adding a rigidbody to freeze its location but I cannot fix the issue.
The score does track properly, and can be seen if you hit pause and find it.

Also I could not get the screen to scroll. It seems I am running a different version of unity.
I was unable to add the nebula_blue to just the plane, instead the entire image is added.

For the extra project component, I added an enemy that shoots 2 bullets at a diagonal.
The spread of the bullets and the ratio of enemies are both modifiable.
